# 2025-advent-of-code

Following along with the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Matlab.

General idea is to have a folder per day with solutions in Matlab scripts/functions and maybe upload some walkthroughs or explanations as needed (video clips?)

## Example (2024)

- An example from [2024 - Day 1](solutions/example/day01/README.md) to show how to go about a solution in Matlab.

## Solutions

- [Day 1](solutions/day01/README.md)



## Ideas

- some things are easy to do in Matlab (arrays, tabular data, and so on). Some other things (eg reading in text data, files and converting into a reasonable shape) might end up a bit harder

- a secondary consideration is to use Matlab's language features to solve the puzzles efficiently (e.g. vectorization, matrix operations, and so on)

- maybe some visualizations (plots, images, animations) where appropriate

- ultmately, functions are better than scripts (more reusable, easier to test, and so on). So maybe try to write functions where possible.
