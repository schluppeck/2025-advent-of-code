# 2025-advent-of-code

Following along with the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Matlab.

General idea is to have a folder per day with solutions in Matlab scripts/functions and maybe upload some walkthroughs or explanations as needed (video clips?)

## Example (2024)

- An example from [2024 - Day 1](solutions/example/day01/README.md) to show how to go about a solution in Matlab.

## Solutions

- [Day 1](solutions/day01/README.md)
- [Day 2](solutions/day02/README.md) - not easy (`julia`!)
- [Day 3](solutions/day03/README.md) - a bit more straightforward
- [Day 4](solutions/day04/README.md) - toilet rolls!

- [Day 5](solutions/day05/README.md)
- [Day 6](solutions/day06/README.md)
- [Day 7](solutions/day07/README.md)
- [Day 8](solutions/day08/README.md)
- [Day 9](solutions/day09/README.md)
- [Day 10](solutions/day10/README.md)
- [Day 11](solutions/day11/README.md)
- [Day 12](solutions/day12/README.md)

## Ideas

- some things are easy to do in Matlab (arrays, tabular data, and so on). Some other things (eg reading in text data, files and converting into a reasonable shape) might end up a bit harder

- a secondary consideration is to use Matlab's language features to solve the puzzles efficiently (e.g. vectorization, matrix operations, and so on)

- maybe some visualizations (plots, images, animations) where appropriate

- ultmately, functions are better than scripts (more reusable, easier to test, and so on). So maybe try to write functions where possible.
