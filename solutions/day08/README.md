# Day 0

- [Problem description](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/8)

Junction boxes and circuits.

## Tips for first problem

Beware of off-by one errors and trying to understand the problem exactly.

Even the first problem today defeated me. I managed to get the code to solve the demo problem, but then got a weird edge case for the big version, which I couldn't debug even after refactoring the code a couple of times.

Some ideas

- distance matrix... got that to work, but somehow the logic for finding the shortest path didn't work out.

## Second problem

No cigar today. Had issues with `Sets` and tried keepin an array list of indices of used Junction boxes... but this probably required some better data structures (and maybe a CS degree - haha)
